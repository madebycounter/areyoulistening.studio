[areyoulistening.studio](https://ayl.gardna.net) was a webstore that allowed for users to customize their own t-shirt to feature nine of their favorite albums. It features an adaptive mobile and desktop site, Paypal integration, automatic email receipts and a host of backend tools used for order management. During the months that it was active, we sold over $1500 worth of shirts. Check out our Instagram: [@areyoulistening.studio](https://www.instagram.com/areyoulistening.studio/).
