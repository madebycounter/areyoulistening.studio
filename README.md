[areyoulistening.studio](https://ayl.gardna.net) was a webstore that allowed for users to customize their own t-shirt to feature nine of their favorite albums. It features an adaptive mobile and desktop site, Paypal integration, automatic email receipts and a host of backend tools used for order management. During the months that it was active, we sold over $1500 worth of shirts. Below are some screenshots from the website in various stages of development. For a look at our marketing, check out our Instagram [@areyoulistening.studio](https://www.instagram.com/areyoulistening.studio/).

I doubt anyone will be able to get this code running again (even I struggle- my mirror for demo purposes is often down), since it was written and built upon as features were required and under great time constraints. I don't consider it my best code, but since I built from the ground up in only a few weeks I'm pretty proud of it.
